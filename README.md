Reading and analyzing hydro(geo)logic time series from the Austrian government's "ehyd.gv.at" platform.

Various tools for exporting and analyzing >10a rain time-series from the [ehyd.gv.at](https://ehyd.gv.at) platform of the Austian government.

If you are interested in a statistical heavy rain analysis like on *(Ö)Kostra*, take a look at my other python package [intensity_duration_frequency_analysis](https://github.com/MarkusPic/intensity_duration_frequency_analysis) which is compatible with this package.

# Install

The script is written in Python3. (use a version > 3.5)

## Windows

You have to install python (i.e. the original python from the [website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).

The following commands show the usage for Linux/Unix systems. 

To use these features on Windows you have to add ```python -m``` before each command 
and you have to add the path to your python binary to the environment variables [^path1].

[^path1]: https://geek-university.com/python/add-python-to-the-windows-path/

There is also an option during the installation to add python to the PATH automatically. [^path2]

## Linux/Unix

Python is pre-installed on most operating systems (as you probably knew).

## Required python packages

Packages required for this program will be installed with pip during the installation process and can be seen in the 'requirements.txt' file.

## Fresh install

```bash
pip install ehyd-tools
```

Add the following tags to the command for special options:

- ```--user```: To install the package only for the local user account (no admin rights needed)
- ```--upgrade```: To update the package

# Usage for general time-series data

- [the general data-reader](example/example_python_api_general.ipynb)
- [the gis extract](example/example_gis_export.ipynb)

# Usage for high-res precipitation time-series

To start the script use following commands in the terminal/Prompt

```ehyd_tools```

## Commandline tool 

With the `-h` (help) flag you can see the complete functionality of the tool.

```bash
ehyd_tools -h
```

> ```
> usage: __main__.py [-h] [-id ID] [--input INPUT] [--max10a] [--start START]
>                    [--end END] [--add_gaps] [--to_csv] [--to_parquet] [--plot]
>                    [--statistics] [--meta] [--unix]
> 
> optional arguments:
>   -h, --help     show this help message and exit
>   -id ID         the id number for the station from the ehyd.gv.at platform
>   --input INPUT  path to the rain input file including the filename
>   --max10a       consider only 10 years with the most availability (for
>                  clipping the data)
>   --start START  custom start time (Format="YYYY-MM-DD") for clipping the data
>   --end END      custom end time (Format="YYYY-MM-DD") for clipping the data
>   --add_gaps     save a gaps-table as a csv-file
>   --to_csv       save the time-series as csv-file (to the current directory if
>                  the id is used or in the directory of the input-file)
>   --to_parquet   save the time-series as parquet-file (to the current
>                  directory if the id is used or in the directory of the input-
>                  file) - parquet is a much faster as csv to read and write
>   --plot         save a bar-plot with monthly sums and availability as a png-
>                  file
>   --statistics   save the basic statistics (sum, max & min) as a txt-file
>   --meta         save the meta-data presented in ehyd as a txt-file
>   --unix         export the csv files with a "," as separator and a "." as
>                  decimal sign (otherwise ";" as separator and a "," as decimal
>                  sign will be used)
